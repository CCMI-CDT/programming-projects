# CDT Programming Projects

This repository will be used to propose projects to be worked on as part of the
[CCMT CDT](https://ccmi-cdt.org/). There projects will be worked on by students
in the CDT alongside their main PhD project and may last for various amounts of
time: from a few months to multiple years.

Once per university term, the CDT will hold a software week. These software weeks will include
time to discuss these software projects and celebrate progress made on them, as well as planning
future work on existing and new projects.

## Proposing a project

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you will need to create one before you can propose a project.
Once you're logged in to GitHub, a project can be proposed by [opening an issue](https://github.com/CCMI-CDT/programming-projects/issues/new?template=project-proposal.yml)
on this repository using the "Propose a project" template form.

Anyone associated with Imperial, UCL or one of CCMI's partners is encouraged to propose a project.
This includes, but is not limited to, academics, postdocs, research software engineers, and PhD students
including those that are part of the CDT itself.

The proposer of a project is expected to commit some time towards guiding students taking part
in the project and reviewing their contributions. The size of the time commitment will vary
depending on the nature of the project.

The "Propose a project" form will ask you to enter:

- The title of your project
- Your name, department and university
- Anyone else relevant to the project (optional)
- A brief description of application area relevant to the project
- A brief description of the project
- Any outputs this project may lead to
- The programming language(s) that this project will use (if decided)
- Links to pre-existing code this project will use (optional)
- Link to relevant literature (optional)

Project proposals submitted using this form will be visible to the public, so please only enter
information that you are happy for anyone to view.

## Getting involved in a project

You can browse the list of currently proposed projects on [this repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/cdt-programming-projects/issues).

If you are a student in the CDT and want to be involved in working on a project,
the easiest way to express this is to comment on the issue for the project. You can also
use the issue to ask questions about the project.
It may be possible (and often is actively desired) for multiple people to work on a
project together, so don't be immediately put off if someone is already working
on a project that looks interesting to you.
