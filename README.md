# CDT Programming Projects

This repository will be used to propose projects for the
[CCMT CDT](https://ccmi-cdt.org/)'s software weeks.

## Software weeks

Once per university term, the CDT will hold a software week. During these
weeks, the students will have the opportunity to work on shorter softwarw
projects proposed by members of UCL and Imperial.
The location of the software weeks will alternate between Imperial and UCL.

## Proposing a project

A project can be proposed by opening an [issue](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/cdt-programming-projects/issues)
on this repository.

The issue templates for this are currently in development. More details will
be added here once this is done.
