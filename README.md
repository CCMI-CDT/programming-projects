# CDT Programming Projects

This repository will be used to propose projects for the
[CCMT CDT](https://ccmi-cdt.org/)'s software weeks.

## Software weeks

Once per university term, the CDT will hold a software week. During these
weeks, the students will have the opportunity to work on shorter software
projects proposed by members of UCL and Imperial.
The location of the software weeks will alternate between Imperial and UCL.

## Proposing a project

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you will need to create one before you can propose a project.
Once you're logged in to GitHub, a project can be proposed by [opening an issue](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/cdt-programming-projects/issues)
on this repository using the "Propose a project" template form.

The "Propose a project" form will ask you to enter:

- The title of your project
- Your name, department and university
- Anyone else relevant to the project (optional)
- A brief description of application area relevant to the project
- A brief description of the project
- Any outputs this project may lead to
- The programming language(s) that this project will use (if decided)
- Links to pre-existing code this project will use (optional)
- Link to relevant literature (optional)

Project proposals submitted using this form will be visible to the public, so please only enter
information that you are happy for anyone to view.
