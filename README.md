# CDT Programming Projects

This repository will be used to propose projects to be worked on as part of the
[CCMT CDT](https://ccmi-cdt.org/). There projects will be worked on by students
in the CDT alongside their main PhD project and may last for various amounts of
time: from a few months to multiple years.

Once per university term, the CDT will hold a software week. These software weeks will include
time to discuss these software projects and celebrate progress made on them, as well as planning
future work on existing and new projects.

## Proposing a project

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you will need to create one before you can propose a project.
Once you're logged in to GitHub, a project can be proposed by [opening an issue](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/cdt-programming-projects/issues)
on this repository using the "Propose a project" template form.

The "Propose a project" form will ask you to enter:

- The title of your project
- Your name, department and university
- Anyone else relevant to the project (optional)
- A brief description of application area relevant to the project
- A brief description of the project
- Any outputs this project may lead to
- The programming language(s) that this project will use (if decided)
- Links to pre-existing code this project will use (optional)
- Link to relevant literature (optional)

Project proposals submitted using this form will be visible to the public, so please only enter
information that you are happy for anyone to view.
